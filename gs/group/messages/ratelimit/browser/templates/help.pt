  <h2>Change the Maximum Posting Rate</h2>
  <p id="gs-group-messages-ratelimit-intro" class="intro">The 
    <cite class="wordasword">posting rate</cite> determines how 
    frequently each member can post to a group in a single day.
    There are two reasons to set it. First, it prevents one person
    from sending an overwelming number of messages to a group;
    setting a value in the range 10&#8212;30 posts per day will achive 
    this.
    Second, setting a <em>very</em> low maximum posting rate (less than
    10 post per day) can cause people to consider their posts more, 
    because it  creates a high cost to making "me too" posts.
    (The flip side of this is that it can cause a member to post 
    off-topic because he or she can only post a few times per day.)
  </p>
  <p>To change the maximum posting rate carry out the following 
    steps.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log in.</li>
    <li>Visit the homepage for your group.</li>
    <li>Select the <samp class="tab">Admin</samp> tab,
      and click
      <samp class="link">Change the maximum posting rate.</samp>
      The <cite class="page">Change the Posting Rate</cite> page will be 
      shown.
    <li>Enter the maximum number of posts per day in the 
      <samp class="entry">Posts per day</samp> entry.</li>
    <li>Click the <samp class="button">Change</samp> button.
      The maximum number of posts per day that can be made by each 
      member of your group will be set.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="note"><strong class="label">Note: </strong>
    The maximum posting rate does not apply to the administrators of
    the group.
