Introduction
============

This package provides the administrator-interface to the posting-rate
system. The posting rate is the number of posts a member can make to
a group in a particular time-period. However, while the underlying code
supports an arbitary time-period, this user-interface is simplified by
always using 24-hours as the period.

The code that stops people from exceeding the posing rate is in
``gs.group.type.discussion``.
